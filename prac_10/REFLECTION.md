# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Most programs took longer than I expected. This could be due to short breaks inbetween or due to having to look up code that I should've known how to do.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the tasks got bigger my accuracy got worse because I find it hard to estimate how long a large task will take.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That error checking and problem solving takes the most amount of time. If I practiced more and knew how to write the code already I would've been faster.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

What other people prioritise in coding over me. It was interesting to see other peoples comments to my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I found it hard to do code reviews when large bits of code got posted. The ones that stood out was other people fixing their own code which allowed me to praise their good work.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code review 1](https://github.com/egiden/cp1404practicals/pull/2#discussion_r2508478469)

### Explanation

My comment praises a good inline comment for some mathematical code.
When we code calculations it can sometimes be hard to understand what the equation is actually calculating so inline comments help, especially if we need to change code or if it's not working.
Having clear inline comments can make the code easier to find in the program as well.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code review 2](https://github.com/julianajesss/cp1404practicals/pull/5/files/820f1c8941c88f1f4a4956e0584748c9d29330ce..419bb62a699a467d4bf0b6114f4cb6a41940cf5a#r2572702590)

### Explanation

This student wrote a whole program without defining any functions.
It is very important to seperate tasks into functions and then passing parameters through so you can control the flow of what is happening.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

More kivy practice before the second assignment.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Writing classes and programs separately. This made a lot of sense for me and I really enjoyed how it made me think about things logically.
