# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I did actually write practice code from lecture videos this week and referred back to them while doing the prac.
This was very helpful.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
Reading the whole question before I start writing code. And starting the prac earlier in the week.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
Problem-solving and finding out the solutions by checking the learnings.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
Trying to cram in the prac on a friday night at 7pm... 
I study full time and work Friday, saturday, sundays. Also try to keep a social life.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
No requests so far. I'm very happy with the delivery of the teaching. It's nice to be able to do it at my own pace.
Which can change week to week. Sometimes things make sense and I can learn faster and other times I need more breaks.
